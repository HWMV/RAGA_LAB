I regret to inform you that I was unable to gather insider trading data for Microsoft (MSFT) as the tools available do not include a specific tool for accessing insider transactions. This information is essential for a comprehensive financial analysis report. It is crucial to have access to reliable sources that provide accurate information on insider transactions to assess the stock's financial health and performance accurately. I recommend seeking alternative sources or tools to obtain insider trading data for a more thorough analysis.
